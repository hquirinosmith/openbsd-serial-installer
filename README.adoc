= Install OpenBSD via Serial Port

This is an exercise in https://man.openbsd.org/ksh[ksh] scripting and
OpenBSD filesystem commands. The goal is to modify an amd64 install
image so that it uses the serial port `com0` instead of HDMI & USB on
first boot.

== Getting Started
As a point of giving credit, this has been done before. I took a lot of
inspiration from http://www.weirdnet.nl/openbsd/serial/. However, that
tutorial is for a much older version of OpenBSD, and it isn't automated.
In this tutorial, we'll take the time for a modern, automated approach.

=== Some Background
If you have never worked with serial devices before, it can be a bit
confusing at first. However, once you get the hang of it, it can be very
handy!
